# Ford-gobike-analysis
data analysis project for visualization

before starting all the exploration analysis done before in this page it will be for the explanatory analysis so it would lack the cleaning part but feel free to check the exploration part to see how I cleaned the data ðŸ˜„

## Investigation Overview

in this analysis I covered the Ford gobike service and I explored the users and their gender and what type of users and what is the duration for each gender.

## Dataset Overview and Executive Summary

the dataset is Ford gobike service which is a dataset for the serivce that Ford lunched in San Francisco. in this analysis I found that one time customer is way more than subscribers and the duration for each gender where women are more than men when using the service and the type of users who share their bikes and it wasn't the subscribers but the customers.
